#The Long Way
##UCC Computer Science 4th Year Project 2015

This project, codenamed “The Long Way”, demonstrates that predetermined escape routes to the nearest emergency exit are not always the fastest.

The simulation takes into account the location of the hazard, in this case a fire, as well as possible congestion based on the number of people present in different parts of the building.
The simulation assumes we are aware of the number and the location of people in the building, detected via motion sensors, facial recognition, WiFi people counters, etc. as well as the location of the fire via flame, smoke or heat sensors.

The Long Way demonstrates the possible application of algorithms for real-time evacuation via simulation using the Unity3D game engine.

This project uses [A* Pathfinding Project](http://arongranberg.com/astar/).
